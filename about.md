<h1 class="is-size-3">About Me</h1>

<h2 class="is-size-4">Why Sleeping King Studios?</h2>

<p>
  Born with an extremely common name, I wanted something more evocative to represent my work. I chose Sleeping King Studios as a nod to the Arthurian myths.
</p>

<h2 class="is-size-4">Why Open Source?</h2>

<p>
  I've been a professional engineer for over a decade, and that experience informs my open source work. The projects I choose to work on are designed to smooth the sharp edges and fill in the gaps of the development process, reducing repetition and boilerplate code while providing powerful tools to build, test, and document applications.
