Welcome to Sleeping King Studios. I'm Rob Smith, a software and web technologies developer with an occasional sideline in game design and development. Sleeping King Studios is a showcase for my work and a forum for exploring my interests in the theory, philosophy and practice of tabletop and computer gaming, along with varied and sundry other musings and cogitations.
